       <p>The world is at war.<strong>Alliance </strong> 
        Alliance challenges you and your opponents to decide 
        the outcome. As one of the world powers

        <h2>Tedious and Confusing</h2>
        <P>The list of war simulation games is long. All of them 
            share similar features including the 
            formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated 
            through random draws of a deck or the 
            roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that 
            is new or innovative in that regard.</P>

        <h2>Decent Game but Many are Better</h2>
        <p>Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the 
            game play to be robust and engaging. The 
            rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with 
            experience in this class of board games, there 
            is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We 
            think the battle simulation cards are some of 
            the best we have encountered.

        <h2>Fun and Challenging</h2>
        <p>.Alliance is fun game and is sure to appeal to 
            war game enthusiasts. We think it offers several new 
            ideas that we're surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card system and the 
            investment options give the game a "real world" feel.
